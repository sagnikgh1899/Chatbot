This is the implementation of the Heuristic limit based approach mentioned in the following paper:
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7816913

Algorithm runs in O(n * w) time and with O(n) auxiliary space. [where n = length of dataset, w = window width]
The data sets are all time series datasets.
